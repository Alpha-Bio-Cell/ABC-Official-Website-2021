                2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conservation of wildlife is a pressing issue. The past 4 decades have noticed a 60% dip in the population of species. In such dire situations, smart wildlife tracking and monitoring systems become a watershed moment for conservationists, researchers, and anti-poaching teams.  However, the issue lies in the reliability of satellites and other tracking devices and the expenses at which they come. Depleting batteries can also create a malfunction in tracking software. Develop a UI/UX design of an app/software along with reliable software that can track animals with more accuracy.

                5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The emergence of the metaverse brings in opportunities for the healthcare industry to utilize it in the fields of surgical operation, medical training and many more sectors. This can help perform complicated surgical procedures and enhance patient care. As surgical procedures were already using robotics, now complicated surgeries are all set to use AR for efficient diagnosis using tech e.g. smart glasses. But this innovation has urgent difficulties in the medical services area. But security and protection of e-PHI (Patient Health Information) is the principal constraint of the metaverse. Develop a UI/UX software/ app design that protects the information of individuals and creates network safety arrangements for organizations to avoid privacy leaks.

                7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The geographic population varies everywhere. The recent pandemic made us realize the importance of data analytics. For our predictions to be accurate we require strong statistical data regarding the population for efficient management of the people. However, challenges lie in the topography of the place, weather conditions, standard of living, commutativity in the area etc. and the fact that the population is not evenly distributed, it could be sparsely or densely populated. Develop a UI/UX design for a software/app tool for tracking the density of the population and controlling and managing people.

                8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We consume a tremendous number of poultry-bred animals for food. Almost 8 billion chickens are consumed every year by humans. At times raw meat may not be sold in the most sanitary conditions and may have traces of infected blood, or contagious diseases are also common in poultry that can easily go undetected. Hence, it is necessary to trace the medicines and food consumed by the animals for safe consumption. Design a UI/UX design for a software/app to identify the traceability of food chains, making poultry food safer.

                9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prosthetics are artificial devices to replace or augment a missing or impaired part of the body. Prosthetic limbs are made from plastic polymers, which bond fabric-based layers together to make a prosthesis that is strong yet lightweight. Manually made prosthetic devices may lack the accuracy of measurements in lengths and circumference. Devise a UI/UX design of an app/software that can take accurate measurements to make prosthetics of the precise and perfect fitting.

                10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every year in India, the states like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Assam are hit by floods. Out of India’s total geographical area of India, more than 12% is flood-prone. Human life and property are destroyed since they could not receive warnings beforehand. Devise a UI/UX design for an app/software which can detect the possibility of occurrence of a flood by determining the basic factors of a tide. It should calculate the height, velocity and other important factors. Also include closest higher grounds, helpline numbers etc.

                11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Farmers use fertilizers and pesticides to yield the growth of crops. At times it leads to the accumulation of high proportion phosphate and nitrate in the soil. Develop software which can analyze the fertility, porosity, nutritive value etc of the soil. It should also display the amount and type of fertilizers which are used to replenish the soil in specific areas. Create a UI/UX design for an app/website that facilitates easy access and analysis report of soil characteristics along with supplements required for the betterment of soil quality.

                12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smart Grid facilitates an efficient end-to-end intelligent two-way delivery system from source to sink. Thus, it ensures efficiency and sustainability in meeting the growing electricity demand and in easier integration and higher penetration of renewable energy. However, it is associated with cybersecurity vulnerabilities while connecting the grid to cyber-physical systems and inadequacy in grid infrastructure to accommodate future needs and deployment and maintenance challenges. Thus, try and develop a UI/UX design of an app or website which will help in tackling this problem.
